Done so far:
1) Matrix/vector math for rotation/movement;
2) Collision detection using GJK+EPA and custom hitboxes;
3) Physics:
    - unrestricted acceleration, 
    - mirror-bumping on collision;
4) Gameplay:
    - limited energy to accelerate/brake/shoot,
    - damage on projectile/object collision;
