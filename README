Done:
0) Code reorganization:
    - prototype inheritance for methods,
    - precalculated models;
1) Matrix/vector math for rotation/movement;
2) Physics:
    - unrestricted acceleration, 
    - mirror-bumping on collision,
    - GJK+EPA collision detection (explodes sometimes, looks like edge/plane bug), custom hitboxes;
3) Gameplay:
    - limited energy to accelerate/brake/shoot,
	- smooth mouse control,
    - damage on projectile/object collision,
	- camera modes: center-on-target freeflight, Y-autopilot for 2D plane fight;
