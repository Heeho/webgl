Done so far:
1) Matrix/vector math for rotation/movement;
2) Physics:
    - unrestricted acceleration, 
    - mirror-bumping on collision,
    - GJK+EPA collision detection (explodes sometimes), custom hitboxes;
3) Gameplay:
    - limited energy to accelerate/brake/shoot,
	- smooth mouse control,
    - damage on projectile/object collision,
	- camera modes: center-on-target freeflight, autopitch in 2D plane;
